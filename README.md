# HuffmanCoding-Documentation
Huffman Coding in Python + Extended documentation + FrontEnd


# Info
Here is a Python script for Huffman Coding adding some user-friendly documentation and a basic front end aswell

# Usage
Download the Huffman.py, useHuffman.py, sample.txt and optionally the Monocraft font for I added it as the default font in the front end.
-Run useHuffman.py and it should be good to go
-You can use any txt file or any bin file to compress and decompress respectively, for I added a file explorer in the front end

# Feats
- File compression and decompression
- Use any txt or bin file
- Easy usage
- File preview for txt compression
- Character count in compression function
- Documentation for any user to understand and/or modify

# Disclaimer
This Huffman Coding script isn't of my fully authory, I'll link the original repo below, I only addded a very basic front end, additional documentation in code and some misc. functions from the original script for 
this code to be as user friendly as it gets and to get a good grade in my Algorithm Analysis class :) I took the time to read and appreciate the code myself and I'm thankful that this guy helped me understand 
greedy algorithms via Huffman Coding.
